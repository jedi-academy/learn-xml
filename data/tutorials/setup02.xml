        <p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up virtual
            hosting in XAMPP, for testing webapps.</p>
        <p>The first time may be a challenge, but you will find
            that it is easy to setup a new virtual host for
            any webapp you want to work on!</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Virtual Hosting" layout="normal">
        <p>Apache supports name-based hosting, with multiple domains
            served from the same Apache instance, and each domain
            mapped to its own document root.</p>
        <p>
            We can exploit this by defining our own "local only" domains,
            one for each project we are working on, and have Apache
            treat these as free-standing webapps.
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Windows Note" layout="normal">
        <p>Depending on your configuration, you may find that your
            "system" files are opened as "read-only" when you try to edit them.</p>
        <p>In such a case, on the following slides, you will have to run your
            text editor with elevated privileges, so you can save 
            any changes.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Define Local Domain Names" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Local domain names are defined in the "hosts" file on
                your platform. On Linux, this is found in "/etc/hosts".
                On Windows, this will be found in 
                "%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts", shown right.
            </p>
            <p>You may have to right click the file, 
                select properties, and uncheck "read-only".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <img src="/data/tutorials/pix/1b-1.png"/>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Add Your Domains" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>You can add domains to the main “home” line there, or you can add 
                separate lines for each domain. These will look like</p>
            <p class="code">
                127.0.0.1 localhost<br/>
                127.0.0.1 comp4711.local project.local
            </p>
            <p>Make sure that you add the "comp4711.local" domain, 
                as we will use that for labs. 
                The example above also adds “project.local”, 
                a domain that might be used for your assignments.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <img class="scale" width="890" height="600" src="/data/tutorials/pix/1b-3.png"/>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Test Your Domain Name" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>In a command prompt, ping a "bad" domain, and then ping one 
                that you added to your "hosts". The results should look
                something like the screen to the right.</p>
            <p>In my case, I have a "jimsjoint.local" defined on the
                same line as "comp4711.local", but the result is still
                "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"</p>
            <p>Using “.local” as part of the domain name will serve as a reminder
                that you are in development mode.

    <slide title="Apache Configuration - httpd.conf" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The main Apache configuration file is "httpd.conf".</p>
            <p>Request its editing by clicking on the "Config"
                button in your XAMPP control panel, and selecting
                the appropriate entry.</p>

    <slide title="Enable Virtual Hosting" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Apache's virtual hosting is disabled by default.</p>
            <p>Enable it by uncommenting the "include" directive below
                the "# Virtual hosts" comment, about line 490 in "httpd.conf".</p>
            <p>The Apache configuration files are inside "C:\XAMPP\Apache\conf" on 
                Windows, and inside "/opt/lampp/etc" on Linux, if you want 
                to open them directly.</p>

    <slide title="Virtual Host Configuration" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>We need to define the virtual host mappings for Apache. 
                Edit the configuration file for this, 
                eg  "conf/extras/httpd-vhosts.conf"</p>
            <p>This might be accessible from the XAMPP control
                panel, but it is usually easier to open it for
                editing from your file manager.</p>
        </div>

    </slide>

    <slide title="Define Virtual Host Mappings" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Each virtual host needs to be mapped to its document
                root. Two example mappings are in the default installation.</p>
            <p>You want a "default" mapping, as well as one for each of your 
                virtual hosts. The default mapping is simply the first one
                in the configuration file, and it should use the ServerName
                "localhost".
            </p>
            <p>The VirtualHost port number in httpd-vhosts.conf needs to match the port 
                number specified for Apache if you've changed it for XAMPP 
                (e.g. "Listen 4711")</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">

                <code>

                    ServerName localhost
                    ErrorLog "logs/localhost-error_log"

            <p>DocumentRoot identifies our webapp folder.
                Keep this inside your XAMPP/htdocs.
                Note the Unix style folder separators.</p>
            <p>ServerName is the local domain name.</p>

                local domain names you setup earlier.</p>
            <p>If you defined two local domains, then
                your httpd-vhosts.conf will contain
                three mappings: one for the "default"
                and one for each of yours, as shown to the

    <slide title="Document Root Notes" layout="normal">

        <p>A webapp's document root is the location
            of the folder containing its homepage, eg.
            "index.html" or "index.php".</p>
        <p>Note the Unix-style folder separators whenever
            filename paths are specified - follow this convention.</p>            
        <p>It is <emphasis>possible</emphasis> to have your document root anywhere
            in your file system, but you will save a lot of grief
            at this point by putting all of yours inside
            your XAMPP folder.</p>

    </slide>

    <slide title="Apache Restart" layout="normal">
        <p>Apache only reads its configuration files when
            first started.</p>
        <p>Any time you make a configuration change (for
            instance virtual hosting settings), you need
            to restart Apache.</p>
        <p>This can be done through your XAMPP control panel,
            or from the command line ("xampp restart").</p>     
        <p>Why not do this now, before you forget!</p>       
    </slide>

    <slide title="Test Your Virtual Host Mapping" layout="normal">
        <p>We want to make sure we got it right.</p>           
        <p>We are going to create a simple "Hello World"
            project, in the proper place, and make sure that
            we get the expected results when we use our
            local domain name as the browser location.</p>
        <p>In the last few pages of this tutorial, we use
            the NetBeans IDE. It isn't the only one, or even
            necessarily the best one, but it is the one we have settled 
            on, and which we use for <strong>marking</strong> (hmmm).</p>

            <p>If you changed the Apache server port when you initially
                setup XAMPP, remember to add that to your URL
