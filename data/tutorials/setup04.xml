        <p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up CodeIgniter
            for use with multiple webapps on your computer.</p>
            <p>Instead of bundling the CodeIgniter framework with
            each webapp, we will split the downloaded CodeIgniter
            into 2 or even 3 folders</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="Get CodeIgniter3" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Download CodeIgniter 3 from the project's 
                <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/download" target="_blank">download page</a>
            </p>
            <p>There may be two versions of CodeIgniter3: the "stable" one and the 
                "develop" branch. If so, the stable one will have the user guide
                pre-built, while the develop one will have the source for the user
                guide (build it yourself) and unit tests.</p>
                <p>The "develop" branch is the latest and greatest, though parts of
                it might be experimental.</p>

    <slide title="What Do You Have?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The folder view to the right shows the results of extracting
                the downloaded CodeIgniter3 "develop" archive.</p>
            <p>The "system" folder contains the framework itself, while
                the "application" folder contains a starter webapp, used
                in conjunction with the "index.php" front controller.</p>
            <p>The "license.txt" file is included with all distributions,
                but the other files and folders are only needed for development
                of the framework itself.</p>

    <slide title="CodeIgniter User Guide" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The User Guide for CodeIgniter 3 contains "how to"
                articles, as well as component API references.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/" target="_blank">User Guide</a> 
                can be found online too, or 
                <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/data/CodeIgniter3-dev-userguide.zip">
                    downloaded</a> separately.</p>
            <p>If you downloaded the "release" version of CodeIgniter 3,
                I suggest moving the user guide subfolder into a convenient
                location on your system, for instance your desktop.</p>
                <p>If you downloaded the "develop" version, you might find
                it easier to acccess the user guide online.</p>

    <slide title="Store the Framework" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>It is a good idea to keep the framework itself outside of 
                your webapp.</p>
            <p>This is more secure, and it makes it easy to share
                the framework, and any updates, across multiple webapps.</p>
            <p>Move the "system" folder into your htdocs folder,
                and rename it "system3". That will make it easy to work with
                different versions of the framework for different webapps.</p>

    <slide title="Your Webapp Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>If you eliminate the "develop"-only files and fodlers, what 
                you are left with is an application starter:
                index.php and the application folder.</p>
            <p>The subfolders inside "application" give you a pretty good
                idea of what goes where.</p>

    <slide title="Configure Your Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Tailor the index.php setting that tells CodeIgniter
                where to find the framework files.</p>
            <p>I suggest renaming the folder you are left with, for instance
                to codeigniter3-starter. You will use it to start any new
                CodeIgniter webapp.</p>

    <slide title="Tailor Your Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>We have one last little thing to do for your starter:
                add a ".htaccess" file to the starter's root.
                Its contents are shown right.</p>
            <p>This is an Apache configuration file, which lets us
                reference our webapp controllers without having to include
                the "index.php" portion in a location URL.</p>
                <p>If you are using a different web server, this may not help.</p>

        <div class="right">
            <pre>
                <code>
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
RewriteEngine on

    <slide title="Are We Done Yet?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Let's see. Replace the contents of the folder you have 
                comp4711.local mapped to, with the contents of the
                starter folder you just made.</p>
            <p>Open the homepage for that in your browser.</p>            
            <p>You should see the same as this :)</p>
