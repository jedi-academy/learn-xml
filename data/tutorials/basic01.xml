        <p>This tutorial will walk you through converting a static HTML
            website into a CodeIgniter webapp.</p>
        <p>The approach taken is not the only one possible, or even the best one,
            but it suits "baby steps".</p>
              
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="Get The Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Fork the 
                <a href="https://github.com/comp4711/starter-lab02" target="_blank">lab starter</a>
                project, and clone it to your local system.
            </p>
            <p>You can clone it to any folder inside your htdocs, as long as
                you have a virtual host mapping to it for testing.
                I will assume "comp4711.local" for this writeup.
            If you want to change the destination folder name, that will be the "project name"
            on the third dialog in the git clone wizard of NetBeans.</p>

            <p>I cloned mine to a "my-lab02" project/folder on my system.
                Substitute your choice whenever I refer to my folder.</p>
            <p>You should see a "public" folder, which contains an entire
                static website.</p>

    <slide title="What Does It Look Like?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Assuming that your new project is mapped to "comp4711.local",
                then the URL "comp4711.local/public" should give you the
                homepage of the static site, shown right.</p>

    <slide title="How Do We Make This Into a Webapp?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The basic steps we will follow are shown to the right.
                This tutorial will address the first two steps, and
                each of the next two tutorials will address two additional
                steps.
            </p>
            <p>This isn't the only way to do this job, but is one
                that makes sense. After each stage of the conversion,
                we should still have a working site.</p>
            <p>Er, it will behave like it is working, even though
                it won't be a proper webapp until we are done.</p>

                tutorial "setup04") into your project folder.</p>
            <p>Now, asking for comp4711.local in your browser should
                give you the "Welcome to CodeIgniter!" page.</p>

    <slide title="Create Trivial Controllers" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Our static site has 3 pages, index.html, gallery.html
                and about.html. We can make trivial controllers for each of these,
                which simply load the corresponding "view".</p>
            <p>Fix application/controllers/Welcome.php (your homepage)
                to load the "welcome" view. Create similar controllers Gallery.php and About.php,
                which load the "gallery" and "about" views, respectively.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>We can make trivial views for each of the static pages,
                by copying the static html files to our application/views
                folder, and renaming them to have a ".php" extension.
                Note that index.html would become welcome.php.</p>     
            <p>You may have to rename these using your file manager,
                if your IDE won't let you change the extension.</p>      
            <p>We no longer need the views/welcome_message.php
                from your CI starter.</p>

            <p>Checkout your site now, using the comp4711.local URL.</p> 
            <p>Oops, our image links are broken!</p>

    <slide title="Fix Our Image Links" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Examining views/welcome.php, you can see that the image 
                references no longer work. 
                We can solve this by copying/moving those folders up
                one level, alongside "applications".</p>
            <p>A better practice is to keep your "assets" (like these)
                in a separate folder, which could be called "public" or
                "assets". We can address 
                the better practice in a later refactoring.</p>
            <p>For now, let's copy the folders up one level. </p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>Yay, our site *looks* better, but what about the menu? It still
                refers to the original HTML files. Fix this by changing the menu links to refer to our CI controllers
                instead. Apply this change to each of our three views.
            These menu links will be found inside the views/template.php</p>
            <p>Notice that the homepage is referred to as just "/", and that
                each of the other references start with a slash.</p>

     <slide title="Are We There Yet?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>So far, so good ... the website looks the same as the original,
            but it has been partially transformed into a (trivial) CodeIgniter webapp.</p>
            <p>The next tutorial will take the website to the next level.</p>
            <p>This would be an appropriate point to push your local changes
            to your github repo.</p>
