        <p>The "contacts" webapp is meant to be an example of a simple
            CodeIgniter webapp.
            It reflects design decisions that not everyone would agree with,
            but it suits the intended use, as an example
            for lesson 2.</p>
        <p>Do download the zip for this project from github before reading
            lesson 2, as there are numerous places in that lesson
            which refer to the example.</p>
        <p>Make sure you read the project readme file before trying to run it on your system!</p>
