            some of the model techniques
            from the models lesson.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>Part A addresses three models, and the corresponding changes to 
            our two controllers.</p>
        <p>The menu and orderitems models are trivial, and effectively done. 
            The orders model is where most of the action happens. 
            The orders model has five methods needed, for 1 mark each.</p>
        <p>Making the welcome and order controllers work properly will get you 
            1 and 2 marks, respectively.</p>
        <p>Proper repository branching and workflow make up the last 2 marks.</p>
