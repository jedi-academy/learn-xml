    <slide title="Lab Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to help you explore and practice
            some of the view techniques, incorporating libraries and helpers,
            from lessons 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>I have split the tutorial into 3 parts, because
        it was becoming excessively lengthy
        being all in one.
        I have had positive feedback about the "baby steps"
        in the lab, but that means lots of "pages/slides".</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="Lab Submission" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.
            This will be your (forked) starter-lab05 repo. 
</p>
        <p>Please make sure that your work is in the "master" branch
            or your repository, and that any other branches have
            been merged into it.</p>
        <p>In the lab dropbox, submit a link to your github repository.</p>
        <p>Due: Sun, Oct 25, 17:30 PST</p>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>There are five tasks to complete for the lab.</p>
        <p>Keeping things simple, I will award two marks each,
        even though some are more involved than others.</p>
        <p>Ten steps were planned, taking you further down the rabbit hole
            as it were, but I ran out of time getting the lab together :(</p>

    <slide title="Your Job" layout="normal">

            parts: #5 and #5b!</p>
