            <p>Mick is the team leader. He needs to create an "organization" to
                use as a container for any projects the team wishes to collaborate on.</p>
            <p>The organization name is usually derived from the team name.
                Mick will use <code>rolling-stones</code> as their organization name.

                organization, to share with the team members.</p>
            <p>For this project, he will use the repository name <code>rock-quotes</code>.
                It will be public, so we don't have to pay, and he will have an initial README,
                .gitignore, and license.</p>
            <p>Only the maintainer of the official repository, Mick, can update it.
                That may include updates that break team member's repos, but that is "their"
                problem.</p>

            <p>Before anyone forks the project, Mick should get its initial state
                corrected. He should create a <code>develop</code> branch, and
                set the new branch as the default.
            </p>
            <p>The intent is that all work be done on the <code>develop</code>
                branch, with that being merged into the <code>master</code> branch
                only when the resulting codebase is in a stable state, for
                instance with a new release.

    <slide title="Fork the Shared Repository" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Each team member should now fork the shared repository,
                from <code>https://github.com/rolling-stones/rock-quotes</code>,
                inside their personal repository.
            </p>
            <p>Each team member will have their own project repository,
                derived from the shared one.

        <div class="left">
            <p>Anything produced by a team member will end up in their
                repository until it is merged into the shared one.
                Until then, the member's repository is considered "ahead" of
                the shared one.</p>
            <p>If the shared repository contains other members' work that has not been merged
                into a team member's repository, their repository is considered
                "behind" the shared one.</p>
            <p>
                If the two repositoties match, then the member's is said to be "even" with the shared one.</p>
            <p>A member's repository can be both ahead of and behind the shared one,
                for different pieces of code.</p>

    <slide title="Synchronize Your Fork With the Main Repo" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>If any changes are made to the shared repository (for instance
                by a fellow team member), you will need to synchronize
                your repository with it. If you haven't done so already, you will need to add the remote
                repository, and you should call it "upstream".</p>
            <p>You can then synchronize your repo by
                <ol>
                    <li>Checkout the "master" branch</li>
                    <li>git pull upstream master</li>
                    <li>git push origin master</li>
                    <li>Checkout your topic branch again.</li>

    <slide title="Push your changes to your fork" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>From your IDE, or the command line, push your changes to your 
                server-side repository, "origin".</p>
            <p>You should make sure you are in sync with the shared repository
                before doing this, or you run the risk of ending up with
                horrible conflicts.</p>
            <p>If you get a nasty message when synchronizinging, you will need to resolve
                any merge conflicts before continuing.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>If you switch to your github repository in your browser, you
                will see that github is offering to "compare &amp; pull request".</p>            
        </div>

    <slide title="Initiate the Compare &amp; Pull Request" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Select the "Compare &amp; pull request" link.</p>
            <p>Near the top of the page, it should say that the pull
                request can be automaticaly merged. If it doesn't,
                you did something wrong, most likely forgetting
                to synhronize with the shared repository before pushing
                to your fork.</p>
            <p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page displayed, and make 
                sure that the changes are what you expect.</p>
            <p>If all looks ok, click "Create pull request".</p>

    <slide title="Wait For It..." layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>At this point, you should see the main repository,
                with your pull request center screen.</p>
            <p>You can comment on it, but you will have to wait for the repo
                maintainer to merge or reject your pull request.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">

        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Are We Done Yet?" layout="normal">
        <p>Your pull request might get rejected for any number of reasons.
            You will get an email explaining the decision.</p>
        <p>Once your pull request has been merged, resynchronize
            with the "upstream" repo,
            and you can delete the topic branch on your github repo as well as
            locally.</p>
        <p>This probably sounds like a lot of work, but it will
            start to come naturally to you, and you will appreciate
            the wisdom of shared code management, and some of the steps
            here, once you have two or more developers sharing a repository!</p>
